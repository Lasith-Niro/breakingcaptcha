# Breaking captcha repository
This repository is used to track the report and code for our project in Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ID2223) at KTH.

The aim of the project is to break captchas using deep learning technologies. Initially we will focus on simple captchas to evaluate the performance and move into complex captchas. The training dataset will be generated from an open source captcha generation software. Tensorflow will be used to train the network.

The datasets can be generated using our Java based implementation by using:
`java`
